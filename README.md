# Watch your cash!
The convenient and beautiful designed application created specially for your cost controls 

This application is called "Watch your cash" and it was specially designed for everyone who needs to keep track of their expenses. The application is very light and takes up almost no space, and all your data is stored in a specially developed SQL database for these necessities. So they are not lost when you close the application. The application is absolutely free and it does not use annoying built-in advertising. To make it convenient for you, there are several classic functions provided here: a currency converter and a managed chart of your expenses. 

The application works in 2 languages, which are switched in the settings.
To add your new expense, select the category you spent on this time from the drop-down menu. If the desired category is missing, feel free to select "Other...", and you can add any category of your choice. It works with income absolutely the same way. Above the drop-down menu is your current balance. Do not rush to add billions of money to your account, the balance counter will not show a number greater than 9 999 999 999. This will definitely be enough for you))

On the "Settings" tab, you can clear all the data from your database, select the language (Russian/English) and the background of the application. Be careful, clearing the data does not require any additional confirmations!

On the Currency Converter tab, you can transfer any amount to any other currency units. There is also a limit of 250 transfers per day. If you want more, add your own API key to the site in the settings fixer.io

And finally, the diagram. "Expense schedule". There's nothing complicated here either. You can disable some categories to see, for example, what your percentage expense is in the categories "Family", "Entertainment/Recreation" and "Gifts". Unfortunately, there is no beautiful background, but you can save any graph as a .png file. The chart is updated every time a new expense is added. 

I want you to enjoy using this app. It was created with love for you, the users. Good luck to you and let your money never run out!!
